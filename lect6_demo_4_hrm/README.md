# Circuit Playground (Bluefruit) HRM 

This project demonstrates how an Arduino board with Bluetooth can act as a BLE Heart Rate Monitor. 

It shows how we start advertising a service and characteristic, and after a device connects and requests data notifications, we send the data. 

NOTE: This project is not actually sending real HR data, it's just sending a number we're counting with.
